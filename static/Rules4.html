<h2><b>
9) Health Calculation
</b></h2>
<p>
  When two (or more) opposing pieces are side by side a melee is formed, regardless of which player moved. The health of all pieces is recalculated on every move during
  a turn. Any piece with a negative health is due to be captured at the end of the turn. Such a piece changes color to grey.
  As further pieces are added to a melee, a grey piece due to be captured, may recover it&apos;s health and have it&apos;s color 
  restored. Just as a reminder:
  <ul>
    <li>A piece is said to be &quot;flying&quot; a colour if that colour is one of the two colours shown on the current top face.</li>
    <li>A piece is said to be &quot;empowered&quot; if it stands on a hexagon of it&apos;s own body colour.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>This section shows how the health algorithm works and the following sections give a few example melees.
<br>
Consider two pieces side by side.
<ul>
  <li>Either the two pieces are the same shape so the "Supporter Table" is used</li>
  <li>Or the two pieces are different shapes so both the "Defender Table" and the "Attacker Table" are used</li>
</ul>
</p>

<div class="rowM1">
  <div class="columnM1">
    <p>
      Each friendly piece adjacent to this piece can potentially increase our health. However, the friendly neighbour 
      must be flying our body colour to give us +1, or even +2 if also empowered.

      During an attack, the status of the attacker is taken into account to determine the damage to the defending piece. The crucial factor
      determining the health of the defender is whether, or not, one of it's flying colours matches the body colour of the attacker. No match 
      means no defense leading to a damage of -20. The attackers table shows the order of priority for ...

  Assuming this scenario was the result of the cylinders turn, the health algorithm would have been repeatedly executed.
  The red block and the yellow block would have become grey, indicating that they have been captured. Once the turn ends, 
  the captors, namely the yellow and red cylinders would gain an extra move. Meanwhile, the captives return to their home
  positions and the game count of captures is updated accordingly.

  Assuming this scenario was the result of the blocks turn, the health algorithm would have been repeatedly executed.
  The orange cylinder and the green cylinder would have become grey, indicating that they have been captured. Once the turn ends, 
  the captors, namely the green, yellow and blue blocks would gain an extra move. Meanwhile, the captives return to their home
  positions and the game count of captures is updated accordingly.

<h2><b>
  11) Captors and Captives
</b></h2>


<div class="rowM1">
  <div class="columnM1">
    As before, the algorithm computes the health of each piece. With this scenario at the end of a turn, there are two captives 
    and three captors. Both the blue block and the yellow cylinder are captured, they would become grey during the turn. At the 
    end of the turn both would return to their home positions. However, only one side gets to claim the extra move(s) assoicated 
    with being a captor. In this example, if this scenario was created by the ...
    <ul>
      <li>Cylinder Player ... then the yellow cylinder may make an extra move from it&apos;s home position.</li>
      <li>Block Player ... then the blue block may make an extra move from it&apos;s home position <b>and</b> the orange block may 
        may make an extra move from it's current position.
