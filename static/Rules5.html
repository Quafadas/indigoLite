  12) Random Events
</b></h2>
  <p> If configured, random events may occur at the end of any turn with a probability that is configured at the start
    of the game. Such events might include:
  <ul>
  <li>&quot;Tumbling Wind&quot; ... all pieces on the board are flipped over</li>
  <li>&quot;Blue and Orange Recall&quot; ... both blue pieces and both orange pieces are returned home (blue and orange are just an examples)</li>
  <li>&quot;Yellow and Purple Sink Holes&quot; ... all pieces on either a yellow hexagon or a purple hexagon are returned home (yellow and purple are just examples)</li>
  <li>&quot;Hex Slide&quot; ... the coloured hexes on the board slide to new positions, the black hexagons appear to remain stationary </li>
  </ul>
  To disable random events configure a probability of 0.
